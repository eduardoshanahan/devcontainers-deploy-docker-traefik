great. right now, on the browser,  http://eduardoshanahan.com gives a 404, and https://eduardoshanahan.com works but with connection not secure. how can we work to fix that? please think about a plan, and we will go one step at a time. I am not interested in quick fixes, I want to edit the files at src and deploy in production until all works correctly. we can do ssh sessions to the vps if necesary, but please try to work with ansible

I'll review your code and the two reference projects to get familiar with your Traefik security enhancement project. Let me start by exploring the current workspace structure and then examine the reference projects.

I'm ready to work! I've reviewed your code and the two reference projects. Here's what I understand:

**Current Project Status:**
- You have a Traefik security enhancement project with a well-structured Ansible deployment
- Traefik is deployed and running on your VPS at `vps-153d27d0.vps.ovh.net`
- SSL/Let's Encrypt is working but not correctly
- You have a test domain `eduardoshanahan.com` deployed behind Traefik
- The goal is to fix issues until `eduardoshanahan.com` works correctly

**Reference Projects:**
1. **devcontainers-deploy-docker**: Handles Ubuntu/Docker updates and security infrastructure (UFW, Fail2ban, SSH hardening, container security with Trivy)
2. **devcontainers-deploy-docker-static-page**: Deploys the static page at `eduardoshanahan.com` and tests Traefik integration

**Current Implementation:**
- Independent Traefik deployment role with security features
- Production environment with dashboard disabled for security
- Let's Encrypt configuration with your email
- Security headers, rate limiting, and TLS configuration
- Comprehensive testing and diagnostics playbooks

**What I can help with:**
- Diagnosing SSL/Let's Encrypt issues
- Fixing Traefik routing problems
- Implementing security enhancements from your roadmap
- Troubleshooting domain access issues
- Enhancing security configurations

What specific issue would you like me to help you resolve first?

Current Issues Analysis:
HTTP 404: http://eduardoshanahan.com returns 404 instead of redirecting to HTTPS
HTTPS Connection Not Secure: https://eduardoshanahan.com works but shows "Connection Not Secure" (SSL certificate issues)
Root Cause Analysis:
Looking at your Traefik configuration, I can identify several potential issues:
Missing HTTP to HTTPS redirect: Your traefik.yml.j2 template has the comment "Remove the global redirect - we'll handle this at router level" but I don't see the redirect configuration implemented
SSL certificate validation: The "Connection Not Secure" suggests either certificate chain issues or browser trust problems
Domain routing: The static web container might not be properly configured to respond to the eduardoshanahan.com domain
Systematic Fix Plan:
Phase 1: Fix HTTP to HTTPS Redirect
Add proper HTTP to HTTPS redirect middleware in Traefik configuration
Ensure all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS
Phase 2: Fix SSL Certificate Issues
Verify Let's Encrypt certificate generation and renewal
Check certificate chain and browser compatibility
Ensure proper ACME challenge handling
Phase 3: Fix Domain Routing
Configure Traefik to properly route eduardoshanahan.com to the static web container
Verify container labels and Traefik service discovery
Phase 4: Security Hardening
Implement security headers and WAF features from your roadmap
Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
