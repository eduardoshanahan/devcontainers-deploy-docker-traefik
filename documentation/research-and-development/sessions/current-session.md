**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Duration**: Extended
**Participants**: User, AI Assistant
**Status**: Completed Successfully

## Session Objectives

- [x] Analyze existing project structure
- [x] Create research and development documentation framework
- [x] Define project requirements and scope
- [x] Document key decisions
- [x] Create implementation strategy
- [x] Finalize network architecture decision

- Fixed markdown formatting violations (MD022, MD032)
- Ensured all files comply with established standards
- Created rule-compliance-validation rule to prevent future issues

## Current Status

### **Phase**: 1.1 Project Setup and Planning
**Progress**: 100% Complete

### **Phase**: 1.2 Implementation Preparation
**Progress**: 100% Complete

### **Phase**: 1.3 Implementation Ready
**Progress**: Ready to Start

### **Next Steps**

1. **Create Ansible role structure**
2. **Implement Traefik deployment**
3. **Test service discovery**
4. **Create application templates**

## Session Notes

### **Key Insights**

- Project requires comprehensive automation for multi-application deployment
- SSL certificate management must be fully automated
- Service discovery through Docker labels is critical for scalability
- Documentation must support multi-session development
- Network isolation provides significant security benefits with minimal complexity
- Hybrid configuration approach balances security and maintainability

### **Technical Decisions**

- Using Traefik v2.10 for latest features and security
- Implementing automatic SSL certificate renewal
- Standardizing Docker labels for consistent application integration
- Creating reusable Ansible templates for application deployment
- Implementing hybrid network isolation (traefik-public + app-specific networks)
- Using hybrid configuration management (YAML files + environment variables)

### **Architecture Decisions**

- Main domain with subdomain routing strategy
- Hybrid network isolation for enhanced security
- Centralized Traefik dashboard for management
- Comprehensive monitoring and health checks
- Applications on multiple networks for security and functionality
- Secure secrets management with environment variables

## Blockers and Issues

**None currently identified**

## Next Session Planning

**Priority Tasks for Next Session**:

1. Create Ansible role directory structure
2. Implement Traefik deployment playbook
3. Test basic deployment functionality
4. Create application integration templates
5. Implement hybrid configuration management

## Session Metrics
