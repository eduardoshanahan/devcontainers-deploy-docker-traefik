### **Compliant Rules:**
- MD009: No trailing spaces
- MD047: File ends with single newline
- MD038: No spaces inside code spans

## Required Actions

### **Immediate Fixes Required:**

1. **Fix MD022 violations**: Add blank lines before all headings
2. **Fix MD032 violations**: Add blank lines before all lists
3. **Fix MD041 violations**: Replace all emojis with text-based alternatives

## Compliance Status

**Overall Status**: ❌ **NON-COMPLIANT**

**Compliance Rate**: ~30% (3 out of 6 rules compliant)

**Priority**: **HIGH** - Multiple critical violations need immediate attention

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix all markdown formatting violations
2. **Systematic**: Apply fixes to all documentation files
3. **Validation**: Re-run compliance check after fixes
4. **Prevention**: Implement validation in future file creation

This report demonstrates the importance of systematic rule validation as outlined in the rule-compliance-validation.md rule. The violations found show that assumptions about compliance were incorrect and systematic verification was necessary.
