**Impact**: 

- Requires standardized Docker labels across all applications
- Enables seamless application deployment
- Reduces maintenance complexity

**Status**: In Progress

### Decision 2: SSL/TLS Management
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Need to determine SSL certificate management strategy

**Decision**: Use Let's Encrypt with automatic certificate renewal

**Rationale**:

- Free and automated certificate management
- Supports multiple domains and subdomains
- Automatic renewal prevents certificate expiration
- Industry standard for web security

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Self-signed certificates
- Commercial certificate providers
- Manual certificate management

**Impact**:

- Requires proper DNS configuration
- Enables HTTPS for all applications
- Provides automatic security updates

**Status**: In Progress

### Decision 3: URL Structure Pattern
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Need to define URL structure for multiple applications

**Decision**: Use main domain with subdomain pattern (app.domain.com)

**Rationale**:

- Clear separation between applications
- Easy to understand and manage
- Supports unlimited number of applications
- Standard web architecture pattern

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Path-based routing (domain.com/app)
- Port-based routing
- Custom domain per application

**Impact**:

- Requires DNS configuration for each subdomain
- Provides clear application boundaries
- Enables independent SSL certificates

**Status**: In Progress

### Decision 4: Docker Labels Standardization
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Need to standardize how applications integrate with Traefik

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive Docker labels pattern for all applications

**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent application integration
- Enables automatic service discovery
- Provides clear configuration standards
- Reduces integration complexity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom integration methods
- Configuration files
- API-based registration

**Impact**:
- Requires all applications to follow labeling standards
- Enables plug-and-play application deployment
- Provides consistent routing configuration

**Status**: In Progress

### Decision 5: Network Isolation Strategy
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Need to determine network architecture for security and application isolation

**Decision**: Implement hybrid network isolation approach

**Rationale**:
- Provides significant security benefits with minimal complexity
- Applications isolated in their own networks for internal services
- Traefik can still discover and route to applications via shared network
- Follows Docker security best practices

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single shared network (less secure)
- Full network isolation (too complex)
- No network isolation (security risk)

**Impact**:
- Enhanced security through network isolation
- Applications need to be on multiple networks
- Internal services (databases) are protected
- Minimal impact on Traefik configuration

**Status**: In Progress

### Decision 6: Cloudflare Integration
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Domains are registered with Cloudflare, need to determine integration strategy

**Decision**: Use Cloudflare proxy with Full (Strict) SSL mode

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing Cloudflare infrastructure
- Provides DDoS protection and WAF security
- Enables CDN benefits and performance optimization
- Works perfectly with Let's Encrypt certificates
- Minimal additional complexity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- DNS-only mode (no security benefits)
- No Cloudflare integration
- Custom CDN solution

**Impact**:
- Enhanced security through Cloudflare protection
- Improved performance through CDN
- Requires Cloudflare configuration
- Enables advanced security features

**Status**: In Progress

### Decision 7: Fully Automated Deployment Strategy
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Need to create zero-intervention deployment system with everything in files

**Decision**: Implement fully automated, file-based deployment with single-command execution

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates manual intervention and human error
- Enables complete disaster recovery
- Provides infrastructure as code approach
- Ensures reproducible deployments
- Simplifies server recreation process

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual deployment process
- Command-line parameter based deployment
- Partial automation with manual steps

**Impact**:
- All configuration committed to version control
- Single command deployment and recreation
- Complete automation of all processes
- Enhanced disaster recovery capabilities

**Status**: In Progress

### Decision 8: Configuration Management Strategy
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Need to determine best approach for configuration management (files vs environment variables)

**Decision**: Use hybrid approach with configuration files for structure and environment variables for secrets

**Rationale**:
- Configuration files provide structure, version control, and readability
- Environment variables provide security for sensitive data
- Hybrid approach combines best of both worlds
- Follows security best practices for secrets management
- Enables easy CI/CD integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure configuration files (security concerns)
- Pure environment variables (structure limitations)
- Database-based configuration (complexity)

**Impact**:
- Enhanced security for sensitive data
- Maintained structure for complex configuration
- Easy version control for non-sensitive data
- Simplified CI/CD integration

**Status**: In Progress

## Implementation Decisions

### Decision 9: Traefik Version Selection
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Session**: Session 1
**Context**: Need to select appropriate Traefik version for deployment

**Decision**: Use Traefik v2.10 (latest stable)

**Rationale**:
- Latest security updates and features
- Full Docker integration support
- Comprehensive documentation available
- Active community support

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Traefik v1.x (legacy)
- Other reverse proxies (nginx, HAProxy)

**Impact**:
- Access to latest features and security updates
- Requires v2.x configuration syntax
- Better performance and reliability

**Status**: Pending

- Ensures service availability
- Enables automatic failure detection
- Provides operational visibility
- Supports automated recovery

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual monitoring
- Basic ping checks
- External monitoring services

**Impact**:
- Improved reliability and uptime
