# Docker Infrastructure Reference Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the [Docker Installation in a remote Ubuntu VPS with Ansible & Devcontainers](https://github.com/eduardoshanahan/devcontainers-deploy-docker) project to understand what infrastructure will be available for our Traefik deployment.

## Expected Infrastructure Components

### **Base System**
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (standard VPS)
- **User**: Non-root user with sudo privileges
- **SSH**: Configured and secured

### **Docker Installation**
- **Docker Engine**: Latest stable version
- **Docker Compose**: Available for multi-container deployments
- **Docker Networks**: Pre-configured network isolation
- **Docker Volumes**: Persistent storage configured
- **Docker User**: Current user added to docker group

### **Security Framework**
- **UFW Firewall**: Configured with basic rules
- **Network Isolation**: Docker networks for service separation
- **User Permissions**: Proper file and directory permissions
- **SSH Hardening**: Secure SSH configuration

### **System Configuration**
- **Package Management**: Updated apt repositories
- **System Updates**: Regular update mechanism
- **Monitoring**: Basic system monitoring
- **Logging**: Centralized logging configuration

## What This Means for Traefik Deployment

### **Available Resources**
- **Docker Runtime**: Ready for container deployment
- **Network Stack**: Docker networking available
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for Traefik configuration
- **Security**: Basic firewall and network isolation

### **Integration Points**
- **Docker Networks**: Can create dedicated networks for Traefik
- **Volume Mounts**: Can persist Traefik configuration and certificates
- **Port Management**: Can configure port forwarding and routing
- **Service Discovery**: Can integrate with other Docker services

### **Expected File Structure**
```
/var/lib/docker/          # Docker data directory
/etc/docker/              # Docker configuration
/home/user/docker/        # User Docker files
/opt/docker/              # Application containers
```

## Traefik Integration Strategy

### **Network Architecture**
```
Internet â†’ VPS (Port 80/443) â†’ Traefik â†’ Application Containers
```

### **Docker Networks**
- **traefik-public**: External-facing network
- **traefik-internal**: Internal service network
- **application-networks**: Per-application networks

### **Volume Strategy**
- **traefik-config**: Configuration files
- **traefik-certs**: SSL certificates
- **traefik-logs**: Log files
- **application-data**: Application-specific data

### **Service Discovery**
- **Docker Labels**: For automatic service discovery
- **Traefik Providers**: Docker provider for dynamic configuration
- **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring

## Deployment Considerations

### **Prerequisites Met**
- âœ… Docker Engine installed and running
- âœ… User has Docker permissions
- âœ… Network isolation available
- âœ… Security framework in place

### **Additional Requirements**
- ðŸ”„ Traefik container configuration
- ðŸ”„ SSL certificate management
- ðŸ”„ Application routing rules
- ðŸ”„ Monitoring and logging

### **Integration Points**
- **Docker Compose**: For multi-service deployment
- **Environment Variables**: For configuration management
- **Docker Labels**: For service discovery
- **Volume Mounts**: For persistent data

## Questions for Clarification

### **1. Application Deployment Strategy**
- How will other web applications be deployed? (Docker Compose, individual containers, etc.)
- What naming convention should be used for applications?
- How should applications register with Traefik?

### **2. SSL/TLS Management**
- Will you use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificates?
- Do you have custom domain names to configure?
- How should certificate renewal be handled?

### **3. Application Routing**
- What URL patterns should be used? (app1.domain.com, domain.com/app1, etc.)
- Should there be a default landing page?
- How should health checks be configured?

### **4. Monitoring and Logging**
- What level of monitoring is required?
- Should logs be centralized?
- What metrics should be collected?

### **5. Security Considerations**
- Should applications be isolated in separate networks?
- What authentication mechanisms are needed?
- How should secrets be managed?

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze the Docker installation project** in detail
2. **Define Traefik configuration strategy**
3. **Plan application integration approach**
4. **Design network architecture**
5. **Create Ansible roles for deployment**

## My Understanding

Based on my analysis, I understand what we're trying to achieve:

### **Project Goal**
Create an Ansible-based deployment system for Traefik that will act as a reverse proxy for multiple web applications on a single VPS.

### **Architecture**
```
Internet â†’ VPS (Port 80/443) â†’ Traefik â†’ Multiple Web Applications
```

### **Key Requirements**
1. **Traefik as Reverse Proxy**: Route external requests to appropriate applications
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatically detect and route to new applications
3. **SSL/TLS Management**: Handle certificates for secure connections
4. **Multi-Application Support**: Ready for future web application deployments
5. **Security**: Network isolation and proper access controls

### **Questions for Clarification**

1. **Application Deployment**: How will other web applications be deployed? (Docker Compose, individual containers, etc.)

2. **Service Discovery**: Should Traefik automatically discover new applications using Docker labels, or will routing be manually configured?

3. **SSL/TLS**: Will you use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificates, or do you have custom certificates?

4. **URL Structure**: What URL pattern do you prefer? (app1.domain.com, domain.com/app1, subdomains, etc.)

5. **Network Isolation**: Should applications be isolated in separate Docker networks for security?

6. **Configuration Management**: How should Traefik configuration be managed? (Environment variables, config files, etc.)

Do these questions help clarify the scope, or do you have specific preferences for any of these aspects?
