# Docker Infrastructure Reference

## Overview

This document analyzes the existing Docker infrastructure on your VPS to understand how Traefik can be integrated as a reverse proxy.

## Current Docker Setup

### **Docker Engine**

- **Version**: Latest stable Docker Engine
- **Installation**: Automated via Ansible
- **User Management**: Dedicated `docker_deployment` user
- **Permissions**: User added to docker group

### **Network Configuration**

- **Default Subnet**: 172.20.0.0/16
- **Network Driver**: Bridge
- **Network Isolation**: Available for container separation
- **Port Management**: Firewall rules configured

### **Security Framework**

- **User Isolation**: Dedicated deployment user
- **Network Isolation**: Separate networks per project
- **Port Restrictions**: Only necessary ports open
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Key-based access only

## Traefik Integration Points

### **Docker Integration**

- **Docker Socket Access**: Available for container discovery
- **Docker Labels**: For automatic service discovery
- **Traefik Providers**: Docker provider for dynamic configuration
- **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring

## Deployment Considerations

### **Prerequisites Met**

- PASS: Docker Engine installed and running
- PASS: User has Docker permissions
- PASS: Network isolation available
- PASS: Security framework in place

### **Additional Requirements**

- CONFIGURE: Traefik container configuration
- CONFIGURE: SSL certificate management
- CONFIGURE: Application routing rules
- CONFIGURE: Monitoring and logging

### **Integration Points**

- **Docker Compose**: For multi-service deployment
- **Environment Variables**: For configuration management
- **Docker Labels**: For service discovery
- **Volume Mounts**: For persistent data

## Questions for Clarification

### **1. Application Deployment Strategy**

- How will other web applications be deployed? (Docker Compose, individual containers, etc.)
- What naming convention should be used for applications?
- How should applications register with Traefik?

### **2. SSL/TLS Management**

- Will you use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificates?
- Do you have custom domain names to configure?
- How should certificate renewal be handled?

### **3. Application Routing**

- What URL patterns should be used? (app1.domain.com, domain.com/app1, etc.)
- Should there be a default landing page?
- How should health checks be configured?

### **4. Monitoring and Logging**

- What level of monitoring is required?
- Should logs be centralized?
- What metrics should be collected?

### **5. Security Considerations**

- Should applications be isolated in separate networks?
- What authentication mechanisms are needed?
- How should secrets be managed?

## Next Steps

1. **Analyze the Docker installation project** in detail
2. **Define Traefik configuration strategy**
3. **Plan application integration approach**
4. **Design network architecture**
5. **Create Ansible roles for deployment**

## My Understanding

Based on my analysis, I understand what we're trying to achieve:

### **Project Goal**

Create an Ansible-based deployment system for Traefik that will act as a reverse proxy for multiple web applications on a single VPS.

### **Architecture**

```text
Internet → VPS (Port 80/443) → Traefik → Multip
```

### **Key Requirements**

1. **Traefik as Reverse Proxy**: Route external requests to appropriate applications
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatically detect and route to new applications
3. **SSL/TLS Management**: Handle certificates for secure connections
4. **Multi-Application Support**: Ready for future web application deployments
5. **Security**: Network isolation and proper access controls

### **Questions for Clarification**

1. **Application Deployment**: How will other web applications be deployed? (Docker Compose, individual containers, etc.)

2. **Service Discovery**: Should Traefik automatically discover new applications using Docker labels, or will routing be manually configured?

3. **SSL/TLS**: Will you use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificates, or do you have custom certificates?

4. **URL Structure**: What URL pattern do you prefer? (app1.domain.com, domain.com/app1, subdomains, etc.)

5. **Network Isolation**: Should applications be isolated in separate Docker networks for security?

6. **Configuration Management**: How should Traefik configuration be managed? (Environment variables, config files, etc.)

Do these questions help clarify the scope, or do you have specific preferences for any of these aspects?
